            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Argument.</head>
            <p>GOing about to ſpeak of the knowledge of God, becauſe in the creation of man the ſame chiefly doth appeare, for that cauſe alſo doeth he treate of man in this Booke: and ſo the ſpeciall places which he handleth herein, are onely two: the firſt whereof is the knowledge of God, the 2. the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man. In the firſt Chapter he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them both: and after particularly of either: yet ſo that in the meane tyme hee toucheth certaine other ſmall thinges, all which notwithſtanding may be referred to either of theſe: he treateth alſo of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of Images, to the knowledge of God: the other three of the making of the world, of Angels, and Deuils, to the knowledge of man. The laſt of all, of the meanes whereby God gouerneth the worlde, perteineth to both. As touching the knowledge of God, he ſheweth firſt what knowledge it is that he requireth. Cap. 2. Secondly where it is to be ſought for, from the 3. to the 9. truely not in man, becauſe (although naturally it be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in mans mynde, yet partly of ignorance, partly of malice, it is choked, the 3. &amp; the 4.
<pb facs="tcp:16356:5"/> nor in the making of the world, becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therein moſt clearely it appeare, yet we are ſo blockiſh, that ſuch teſtimonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer ſo cleare, doe alwayes flote away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs without profit. 5. but in the ſcripture, 6. and ſo being caried to the Scriptures, hee proſecuteth his treatiſe. 7. 8. 9. thirdly, what God is. 10. fourthly, how wicked it is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to God a viſible fourme: where alſo he ſpeaketh of Images, of the adoration of them and their beginnings. 11. fiftly, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to proue that it is meet that God only be wholly worſhipped. 12. Laſt of all, he ſpeaketh of the vnitie of God, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of perſons. Cap. 13. As concerning the other, that is, the knowledge of man: firſt he ſpeaketh of the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, of Angels, of Deuils, that all theſe were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for mans ſake. 14. then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to man him ſelf, he examineth his nature &amp; ſtrength 15. but that both, that is to ſay, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of our ſelues, may better appeare, he deſcendeth againſt fortune and deſteny, to the gouernment of all humane actions: and of the whole worlde. 16. 18.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 In the beginning hée admoniſheth vs to beware of two rockes: firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wée attribute nothing to our ſelues, leaſt Gods honor be therby taken from him, and that we fall with raſhe confidence.

                  <p n="2">2 As touching their other opinion, firſt he bringeth the Philoſophers, then the Eccleſiaſticall writers to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Philoſophers place will as a meane betwéene reaſon and feare, that is to ſay, hauing authoritie ouer her owne power and libertie, whether it pleaſe to obey reaſon, or yéeld it ſelfe to ſenſe to be ſubdued: and howe ſoeuer it bée corrupted and peruerted, when it hath giuen it ſelfe ſubiect into the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſenſe, that if it ſuſtayne to obey reaſon, it is carryed to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of vertues, and holdeth the right way.</p>

More newer writers one after an other continually fell by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle &amp; litle from worſe to worſe, but firſt the Grecians. And firſt as touching the ſignification of the worde, he ſheweth what ſome as well of the fathers as of the newe writers haue thought of free will. The ſumme whereof is, that the name of frée will is rather to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to reaſon, whoſe parte is to diſcerne betwéene good and euill things, and the Adiectiue frée, pertayneth properly to will, which may bée turned to eyther of both.</p>

Moreouer becauſe the ſpirite worketh this good onely, by no other meanes then by faith, hee ioyneth a iuſt entreatie of faith, Chapter 2. Thirdly, to the intent that this holſome faith may the better bee made knowne, ſhewing what fruite doeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16356:101"/> come thereof, hee proueth that true repentance doeth alwayes proceede from it, and reaſoneth much thereof, from the thirde to the tenth.

Of indulgences alſo, and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, Chapter 5. Laſt of all, that hee may ſpecially ſpeake of true repentance, that is, the two partes thereof, of mortification of the fleſhe, and quickenyng of the ſpirite: ſo deſcending to the life of a Chriſtian man, which conſiſteth in both of them, from the ſixth to the tenth. Fourthly, more plainely to ſhewe what the profite of this faith is, and what effectes followe, Firſt hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of iuſtification of faith, from the eleuenth to the eighteenth. Moreouer, of Chriſtian libertie, which is as it were an appendix of iuſtification, Chapter 19. Fifthly, hee deſcendeth to prayer, becauſe the ſame is the principall exerciſe of faith, &amp; as it were the mean or inſtrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we dayly take holde of Gods benefites Chapter 20. Sixtly becauſe before hee had

Leaſt this ſhould ſeeme abſurde, hee ioyneth a ſpeciall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Gods Eternall election, from the one &amp; twentie, to the foure and twentie.

               <p>The ſecond place of ſacraments hath three parts, for firſt he entreateth of ſacramentes, generally 14.

But there are two things that are wont alwaies to ſpring and flowe out of this fountaine: The firſt is, that wée wiſely and diligently auoide all occaſions.
